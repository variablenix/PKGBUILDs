# Prosody - Stable Build
This Arch PKGBUILD will build the latest source package found on https://prosody.im/downloads/source/ instead of using the [Arch Prosody package](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/prosody/) that installs a development build - which is probably not recommended for production environments.
